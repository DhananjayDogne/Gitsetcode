Greetings, esteemed individuals,

I extend my regards as Shraddha Nigwal, a second-year B.TECH student enrolled in the Computer Science And Engineering program at SAMRAT ASHOK TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE, Vidisha.
Currently, I am an active participant in the National Service Scheme (NSS) Organization, dedicating myself to community service.
I proudly hold the position of a Mentee at GITSET CODE, where I am continually refining my skills. Alongside this, my proficiency encompasses fundamental aspects of Python programming and HTML/CSS.
I have successfully orchestrated various modest projects utilizing HTML and CSS. At present, I am engrossed in an intensive Web Development training and immersed in an internship facilitated by INTERSHALA.
Beyond academia, my interests encompass indulging in television content and engaging in outdoor sporting endeavors.
